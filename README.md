# Children-Mental-Health-Site
A website to hold a story book made for children to teach them about mental health.
Site will be created from scratch using html5. The goal is to create an easy to read story book for children to learn about the impacts of mental health. More specifically, how can mental health impact children in their development and transitiion into adulthood.
Basic site goals: Have 'next and 'previous' buttons to turn pages in the book, when the page turns it should trigger a noise.
